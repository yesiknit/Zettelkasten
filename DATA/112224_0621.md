- Keeping  _notes_  as you  _read_  is like having a  _conversation_  with a  _book_ .
    - p.72 "The outcome of reading with a pen in the hand is not possible to anticipate either, and here, too, the idea is not to copy, but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read."
    - I can see where having a way to take a note of any kind while reading would be advantageous. I never thought of writing it in my own words like having a conversation with what I am reading.
