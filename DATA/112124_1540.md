-  _Hope_  comes from  _possibility_  which creates  _desire_ .
    - P.194 "Without the conviction that the fulfillment of a desire is possible, there is no hope - and therefore no desire."
    - If you think something is not possible you loose hope and desire for it goes away. As long as the possibility remains then hope remains.
