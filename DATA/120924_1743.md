- 03/16/24 - "Don't run when no one is chasing you."  - magicians adage - This means that if the spectator doesnâ€™t know what comes next in the routine or when the sleight-of-hand will happen, then why rush through the routine and ruin the moment.
- Enjoy the view, stop and smell the roses, intentionally slowing down when not in a rush.
