- If we could engineer our  _desires_  what would you  _want_  to want?
    - p.188 "Historian Yuval Noah Harari ends his book  __Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind __ with these words: 'But since we might soon be able to engineer our desires, too, the real question facing us is not 'What do we want to become?,' but 'What do we want to want?' ... the question implies that it's possible to want to want something, yet not be capable of wanting it. ... We cannot want what we lack a model for."
    - "Want to want" - I desire to have a desire. Taking the first step might be boring, but continuing to step creates momentum building to desire.
